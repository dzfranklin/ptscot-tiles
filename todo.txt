Consider using OS data for everything walkhighlands does:
https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/news/walkhighlands-map-server-and-tiles/
    OS data © Crown copyright and database right (2022)
    This data is used for the contours, height data, all topographic data (crags etc), woodland & forests, water
    features, settlements, roads, railways. The source data is available from the OS under the Open Government Licence
    (OGL).

    This data is used for (most) paths, tracks, public toilets, footbridges, fords, wind turbines on these maps. The
    source data is available from the OSM under the Open Database License (ODbL). As footpaths are crowd-sourced by
    OpenStreetMap, they may not always exist on the ground.

I think OS OpenMap Local is more detailed for the fewer features it has: https://docs.os.uk/os-downloads/contextual-or-derived-mapping/os-openmap-local/os-openmap-local-technical-specification/feature-types
