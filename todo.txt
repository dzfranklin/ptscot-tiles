OS font for os data?

OS VectorMap:
       woodland: Add OS woodland b/c it shows corridors better than OSM?
       railway_station?
       named place? (probably need hydrography to label OS waterways, maybe others)
       functional site? (i.e. church, maybe want to use OS symbols to match OS maps)
       administrative_boundary?
       surface_water_line & surface_water_area


Lower than zoom 10 it would be nice to show simple poly hillshading like outdooractive does

Consider using OS data for everything walkhighlands does:
