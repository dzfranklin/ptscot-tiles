match water os labels to their geometries and give them a rotation?

How to get park boundaries?

Lower than zoom 10 it would be nice to show simple poly hillshading like outdooractive does
plus contours filled categorically like os does for the 125k product

show wind turbines at low zoom (below 10?)

increase visibility of pylons

paths
