  fields:
    distinctive_name: |
      The settlement name or geographic place name.
      When a place is dual named, the Welsh or Gaelic name is presented first, followed by a space, a forward slash,
      a space and then the English name.
    font_height: |
      A suggested text size to use for placing the distinctiveName as cartographic text.
      For most names the text size is proportional to the size of the area to which the name applies.
      For valleys the text size is based on the valley length and for hills/mountains, the text size is based on the
      height of the summit. [Valid values](https://docs.os.uk/os-downloads/contextual-or-derived-mapping/os-vectormap-district/os-vectormap-district-technical-specification/code-lists/fontheightclassification)
